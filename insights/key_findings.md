## Key Findings – NR-AR Toxicity (Tox21)

- NR-AR toxic compounds are enriched in a moderate molecular weight range (~200–450 Da), while very high molecular weight compounds are predominantly non-toxic.
- Increased lipophilicity (LogP ~2–6) shows the strongest association with NR-AR toxicity, indicating hydrophobic interactions may contribute to receptor-related risk.
- TPSA exhibits substantial overlap between toxic and non-toxic compounds, suggesting polarity alone is not a strong discriminator for NR-AR toxicity.
- Toxic compounds show higher prevalence of moderate ring counts (2–4), indicating structural complexity may play a role in toxicity risk.
